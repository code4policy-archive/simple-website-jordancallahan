        An introductory programming class is designed to teach the fundamental
        concepts of computer programming. Students will learn the basics of
        programming syntax and data types, as well as how to write control
        structures and algorithms. These concepts form the building blocks of
        computer programming, and are essential for students who want to start
        their journey in the field.
      </p>

        In an introductory programming class, students will learn how to use
        various programming languages such as Python, Java or C++. They'll also
        gain a deeper understanding of the logic and structure of programming
        through hands-on exercises and projects. This class is designed to be
        accessible to students with little to no programming experience, so no
        previous knowledge is needed to get started.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, a good introductory programming class will also introduce
        students to more complex topics such as object-oriented programming, and
        Web development basics. This will provide a solid foundation for
        students to move on to more advanced programming classes and/or to start
        coding on their own. By the end of the class, students will have a solid
        understanding of the basics of programming and the tools they need to
        start creating their own programs.
